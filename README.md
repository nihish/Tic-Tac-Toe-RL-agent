# Tic-Tac-Toe with Reinforcement Learning Agents


This repository contains a Python implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where both players are controlled by Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how RL can be used to learn optimal strategies in a simple game environment.

Features
Tic-Tac-Toe Game Environment: A simple 3x3 grid for the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game.
RL Agents: Two RL agents (one for each player) learn and make decisions based on their game experiences.
Q-Learning: Implemented using Q-Learning, a model-free RL algorithm, where agents explore and exploit strategies to maximize their rewards.
Training: Agents play multiple games to learn from the outcomes, improving their strategies over time.
Evaluation: Ability to evaluate the performance of trained agents and track their progress.
